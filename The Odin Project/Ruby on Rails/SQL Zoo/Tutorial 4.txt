1. List each country name where the population is larger than 'Russia'.

SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE population >
     (SELECT population FROM world
      WHERE name='Russia')

2. Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.

SELECT name FROM world 
WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND gdp/population > (SELECT gdp/population FROM world 
WHERE name = 'United Kingdom')

3. List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing 'Belize', 'Belgium'.

SELECT name, continent FROM world 
WHERE continent IN (SELECT continent FROM world 
WHERE name = 'Belize' OR name = 'Belgium')

4. Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland? Show the name and the population.

SELECT name, population FROM world 
WHERE population > (SELECT population FROM world 
WHERE name = 'Canada') AND population <(SELECT population FROM world 
WHERE name = 'Poland')

5. Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.]

SELECT name FROM world WHERE gdp > (SELECT MAX(gdp) FROM world WHERE continent = 'Europe')

6. Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
  WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area >0)

7. Find each country that belongs to a continent where all populations are less than 25000000. Show name, continent and population.

SELECT name, continent, population FROM world
WHERE continent not in (SELECT DISTINCT continent
FROM world WHERE population >= 25000000)

8. Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.

SELECT name, continent FROM world x 
WHERE population > 3 * (SELECT MAX(population) FROM world y 
WHERE x.continent = y.continent AND x.name <> y.name)
